                <h2>Hermiston Region</h2>
                <p> This area is located in North East of Oregon and it is part of Umatilla and Morrow Counties.
                     The region has large agricultural industry (about 73% of land) Includes large food processors
                    and also energy providers
                    (Hydropower – 980 MW, Natural gas – 900 MW, Wind – 545 MW)
                </p>
                <p>Three major river systems make up the Umatilla Basin:</p>
                <p>The Umatilla River (100 miles in length)</p>
                <p>The Walla
                    Walla River (61 miles in length)</p> <p> The Willow Creek (79
                miles in length)</p>

                <p>All three rivers flow from their headwaters
                    in the Blue Mountains to the Columbia River. The
                    Umatilla River drainage and the northern portion of the
                    Walla Walla River drainage are mostly in Umatilla County.
                    The southern portion of the Walla Walla River drainage
                    is in Washington State. The Willow Creek drainage is
                    mostly in Morrow County, the confluence with the Columbia
                    River is in Gilliam County. These rivers support bull
                    trout, Redband trout, Pacific lamprey, fall and spring Chinook
                    salmon, Coho salmon and steelhead. The Umatilla
                    Basin is characterized by irrigated agriculture at lower elevations,
                    with grazing and timber lands at higher elevations.
                    Elevations within the basin range from less than 300 feet at
                    the Columbia River, to above 6,000 feet at the highest
                    peaks of the Blue Mountains. Agricultural land, both dryland
                    and irrigated, comprise the major portion of the basin.
                    Crops include onions, corn, dry and green peas, and potatoes.
                    The basin also contains many fruit orchards (cherry,
                    apple, peach, pear) and vineyards. In 1990 DEQ declared
                    the Lower Umatilla Basin a Groundwater Management
                    Area because nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in many area
                    groundwater samples exceed the drinking water standards
                    for nitrate (10 mg/l). The groundwater area covers the lower
                    portions of the Umatilla and Willow Creek drainages.
                    There is a Pesticide Stewardship Partnership in the Oregon
                    portion of the Walla Walla River drainage</p>

                <h2>FEW Nexus</h2>
                <p>FEW nexus, by definition, refers to the connections between the food (F) sector, the energy (E) sector, and the water
                    (W) sector that create interdependencies between these sectors. Take for example, the food sector. Production of crops,
                    animal husbandry, food processing, transporting food, etc. all require intensive use and management of water, energy,
                    and land. For example, globally, agriculture is responsible for 70% of water withdrawals (FAO), and 30% of total energy
                    produced in this world is used for food production and supply-chain (UNESCO, 2012). However, with threats to water supplies
                    because of changes such as climate change, rising urban demands, and decreasing storage in surface and ground water systems,
                    the food sector is consequently vulnerable to these threats. At the same time, a growing food sector has increasing energy demands,
                    thereby putting additional stresses on how and how much the energy sector is expected to generate cost-effective energy. However,
                    the energy sector is itself a huge consumer of water (90% of power produced in this world is water-intensive (UNESCO, 2014)), and
                    as a result a growing energy sector adds even more stress on water supplies, which the food sector heavily depends on. Hence,
                    increase in energy demand by the food sector comes with a tradeoff in increase in water use by energy sector and less water
                    available for the food sector. Managing these interdependencies and tradeoffs is immensely critical, in order to ensure that
                    these sectors can evolve in a sustainable manner and effectively respond to threats.   </p>

            <section data-scene="Food">
                <h2>Food</h2>
                <p>In Umatilla Seventy percent of the land or 1,447,321 acres is divided among 1,658 farms (2007 Census of Agriculture).
                    There are 804,065 acres of total cropland (Ibid.) with 357,529 (OAIN 2009) acres harvested and the products sold in 2008.
                    The rest of the land was left fallow, grazed, or enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2008, Umatilla County
                    at $378,961,000 had the second highest agricultural sales among the 36 Oregon counties, behind Marion County (Ibid.).
                    Umatilla/Hermiston and Milton-Freewater primarily produce irrigated agricultural crops. Umatilla/Hermiston produces
                    more than ninety percent of the Field Crops (potatoes, mint, etc.) and Grasses and Legumes in the County. Milton-Freewater
                    produces more than ninety percent of the Tree Fruit and Nuts in the County. Pilot Rock/Pendleton has the highest sales
                    of Grains (44.71%) and Livestock (43.55%) in the County. crops (e.g. potatoes, green peas, asparagus, melons), hay and
                    silage feeds (e.g. alfalfa, corn, pea vines), fruit products (e.g. apples, cherries, prunes, peaches, apricots, grapes),
                    and an extensive livestock industry raising cattle and calves, hogs and pigs, sheep and lambs, and chickens and turkeys.
                    Besides being the largest industry in this county and second largest industry in Oregon, agriculture creates a rural
                    atmosphere greatly desired by many city, rural, and regional people. A comprehensive plan considers agriculture as an
                    irreplaceable natural resource. Its wise use is of as much importance as other resources.

            <section data-scene="Energy">
                <h2>Energy</h2>
                <p>Energy sources in this region include, solar, wind, biofuels, coal and natural gas power plant and hydropower.
                    The Columbia River provides a great potential for hydropower and there are several dams on this river.
                    McNary Dam is among the biggest dams on this river. The dam is 7,365 feet long, rising approximately 183
                    feet above the streambed. It consists of a concrete structure with an earth fill embankment at the Oregon
                    (south) abutment. The spillway is a concrete, gravity- type spillway dam. It is 1,310 feet long, and contains
                    22 vertical lift gates, each 50 feet by 51 feet. The crest is at elevation 291 feet mean sea level
                    and is designed to pass a flood of 2,200,000 cubic feet per second.</p>

                <p>Hermiston Generating Plant (HGP) is located in northeastern Oregon, nine miles south of the Columbia River.
                    HGP is a 474 megawatt highly reliable modern natural gas fueled power plant that provides power for nearly
                    500,000 households in the Pacific Northwest. The plant also provides steam to Lamb-Weston's adjacent potato
                    processing plant. HGP was built by Bechtel for U.S. Generating Company in 1996. The plant is based on two
                    General Electric Frame 7FA combustion turbine generators operating in combined-cycle with two heat recovery
                    steam generators and two steam turbine generators. Perennial owns 50 percent interest in HGP and is the
                    plant's manager and operator. HGP has been recognized by the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division
                    (OR-OSHA) for the plant's exceptional health and safety record.</p>
                <p>The Hermiston Power Project is another power plant with capacity of 546 MW located in Hermiston, Oregon.
                    The plant utilizes two combustion turbines, each with its own heat recovery steam generator, that supplies
                    steam to a single steam turbine generator. The Hermiston Power Project sells a portion of the power it
                    produces into the Pacific Northwest and California power markets as part of Calpine’s Western region
                    of power plants. Calpine also leverages the plant’s quick-responding, natural-gas fired generation
                    and its contracted transmission resources in the Northwest to help integrate wind energy into the
                    region’s power grid. Through agreements with the Constellation Energy Balancing Authority, Hermiston’s
                    output is quickly increased or reduced to compensate for the variability of wind generation. Fueled by
                    natural gas and equipped with advanced emissions control technology, the Hermiston Power Project is one
                    of the cleanest projects of its kind in the state. In 2003, the Hermiston Chamber of Commerce nominated
                    Calpine for the Governor’s Gold Award based on its community support activities.</p>
                <p>Pacific Ethanol Inc. is an ethanol production plant located at the Port of Morrow in Boardman, Oregon.
                    The biorefinery began operations in August 2007 and sells ethanol, wet distillers grains, corn oil, and CO2 . </p>

            <section data-scene="Water">
                <h2>Water</h2>
                <p>Water resources in the Umatilla sub basin include surface water, ground water and waste water. Surface water is
                    derived from Columbia River and its tributaries such as Umatilla River, ponds and water reservoirs. Groundwater
                    is an important resource to the economy of Umatilla County by providing the bulk of the water used for agriculture,
                    as well as for drinking water supplies for the many communities and nearly all of the rural residences. The
                    Umatilla Basin has more groundwater resource areas determined to be “Critical” by the Oregon Water Resources
                    Department than any other part of Oregon. Waste water is coming from residential areas and food processing industries.
                    According to Mucken and Bateman (2017) report, quality of surface water and ground water is critical for
                    residential, agricultural and industrial use and being monitored by Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).</p>
                <h3>Surface water quality</h3>
                <p>Temperature, sedimentation, and nutrients are the most common types of pollution that impair Oregon’s rivers and streams.
                    Impaired water quality drives up the cost of water treatment and limits access to clean water for fish, drinking water,
                    agriculture, and recreation.</p>
                <h3>Ground water quality</h3>
                <p>Groundwater contamination is also a serious issue in some areas of Oregon. Private domestic wells may face contamination
                    issues from nearby failing septic systems. Industry and agriculture can also be a source of pollutants for groundwater,
                    as can surface water and groundwater interactions.</p>

                <p>Most of DEQ’s groundwater monitoring efforts target vulnerable areas or areas of known contamination (i.e., Groundwater
                    Management Areas (GWMAs)). Nitrate is one of the most commonly analyzed contaminants in these areas, with data showing
                    that around 30 percent of groundwater samples detect nitrate at levels that suggest a 22 Chapter 1 – Understand Water
                    Resources Today pollution problem exists (7 mg/L), and around 20 percent currently exceed health standards (10 mg/L).
                    Bacteria are a commonly detected contaminant as well, with about 20 percent of samples showing positive bacteria detections.
                    Arsenic is not as commonly studied, but when sampled in vulnerable groundwater areas, about 30 percent of samples
                    show levels above health standards (10 ug/L). Other contaminants detected in groundwater studies include Dacthal,
                    manganese, lead, iron, aluminum, perchlorate, uranium and vanadium. There have been few studies that investigate
                    contaminants such as current use and legacy pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and
                    volatile organic compounds. Based on data collected in the past five years, when detections of those contaminants are
                    found, they are often far below health standards, if any standards exist.</p>

                    empowers FEW actors to envision and plan towards a resilient future for their local communities. Unlike
                    other tools that focus on the short-term decision-making, InterACTWEL in a long-term planning tool that
                    help communities be more resilient to changes that they do not have control of, such as a severe water
                    restriction or changing state laws. Whenever there is an environmental disturbance (e.g., extreme floods,
                    droughts, groundwater declines, fish diseases) or when there are new agricultural or environmental policies,
                    FEW actors can use InterACTWELs intuitive interfaces to examine how these factors will affect their goals,
                    operations and livelihoods. The scientific models in InterACTWEL allow individual actors to identify
                    potential adaptation strategies from a wide range of management choices available to them, while also
                    enabling them to learn about how their decisions affect other FEW actors. With InterACTWEL local communities
                    of FEW actors can increase their overall capacity to adjust their operations through time, for uncertain
                    and adverse stresses affecting the environment or the economy. Anyone can use and access InterACTWEL; the
                    data-secure tool is easy to navigate and can run on either a desktop or mobile application. How it works:
                    InterACTWEL goes well beyond just being a web-based platform to share data and information among FEW actors
                    in a local region. The system contains advanced scientific models and interactive optimization algorithms
                    that can quickly synthesize and leverage the collective wisdom of FEW actors. The algorithms help identify
                    potential adaptation strategies, while also meeting environmental, economic and social sustainability goals. </p>
